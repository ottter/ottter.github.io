## My Personal Website

I figured that blogging some of my personal projects would be a good motivator to be more productive in my free time and to improve at what I love. There is no set theme, purpose, or timeframe for posts. My current focus will be documenting the creation of my homelab. 

### Make a New Post

1. Create the file: `hugo new posts/example-post-name.md`
2. Edit the post: `vi content/posts/example-post-name.md`
3. Check locally: `hugo server -D` or just publish: `hugo`
4. Publish to github: `git push`

### Tools used
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework (with [cactus](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-cactus/) theme)
* Github Pages && Actions
