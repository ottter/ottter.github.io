## My Personal Website

Forcing myself to write a post about what I do will (hopefully) force me to be more productive and proactive in my 
free time.

### Make a New Post

1. Create the file: `hugo new posts/example-post-name.md`
2. Edit the post: `vi content/posts/example-post-name.md`
3. Check locally: `hugo server -D` or just publish: `hugo`
4. Publish to github: `git push`

### Tools used
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework (with [cactus](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-cactus/) theme)
* Github Pages && Actions
