Let this page mark the start of reating my "first" homelab. That is of course not counting the chia farming setup 
that I posted about when I first set up this website. That... didn't work out. I actually was able to farm 2 chia 
while realizing that it wasn't going to be worthwhile in the longterm. I returned some and was able to break even 
in the end, which is cool...

Current Specs:
* i5-6600k taken through the wringer
* (1) 500GB SSD with similar usage
* (2) 12TB HDD
* (2) Raspberry Pi 3b

I have hopes to transition over to an actual server rack at some point once I make it through the initial learning 
phase, but in the meantime, I will be using mix-n-matched parts left over from old computer builds.

Current Status:
* Proxmox VE 7.1 

I don't have a clear cut goal in mind as I start this. Really it started as wanting a Plex server and stumbling on 
to [r/homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/), so I expect this to develop a lot as I progress.

Goals:
* Firewall/security measures (pfSense)
* System monitoring and analytics (likely Grafana & Prometheus)
* Splunk
* Plex server
* Possible web server (if I want to develop this site beyond what Github Pages can offer)
