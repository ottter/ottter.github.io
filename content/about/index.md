I'm currently a Systems Administrator. Previously I was a Bioinformatics Research Assistant at Middle Georgia 
State University and an IT Project Management intern at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. I have a strong 
interest in DevOps and Information Security. I'm lucky enough that my career choice aligns with my hobbies. I am 
in the process of building a homelab to help develop this hobby and increase my work competency level.
